# 1. What is "RAM" ?

**RAM** stands for **"Report As a Module"**, and is the engine that feeds reports to Rocketgraph. That means 	that each report in Rocketgraphâ€™s marketplace is a small program *(module)* that runs inside the main platform. Reports are independent software packages that hold all report's business logic and presentation.

Rocketgraph is more like a *"cloud"* framework that provides to developers a lot of helpful functionality, removing all the concern about supporting process (not so trivial sometimes). In that way, the developer can focus only on data and visualization.
